#Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
#Output: 7
#Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
#Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

class Solution:
# while语句
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        i=0
        max_profit=0
        while i<len(prices)-1: 
            if prices[i]<=prices[i+1]:
                max_profit += prices[i+1]-prices[i]
            i+=1
        return max_profit

# for语句
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] - prices[i - 1] > 0:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        return profit
